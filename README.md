## Version - 1.0

Hello World, Welcome to the Ultimate Interview Preperation Game...approach with Caution! :monkey:

We created this game to:
1. Learn and have fun at the same time
2. Get our group members more involved
3. Practice our Java skills and inact OOP concepts
4. To make the journey through Cybertek and studying less stressful

## Game Styles Explained
1. Round Robin
  - The topics will be all random and the questions can be repeated but only once. After all questions are presented two times, the game will end.
  - After each question the user will be prompted with a option to Continue or not, so there is a pause.
2. Topic Based
  - Right now, after you choose a topic, the questions will go on continuously(without pause). Settings will be implemented in the future however.
3. More Coming Soon..!

## Exception Handling Guide
###### StringIndexOutOfBoundsException 
- Check the format of any new questions that you added a "." missing after the time can trigger this exception, along with other typos

###### NullPointerException 
- If any new variables are added to the QuestionAndSolution custom class make sure they are initialized!
